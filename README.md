## 🔐 Security Implementation (OWASP Top 10)

### 1. Broken Access Control
- ✅ Route-level protection with `ProtectedRoute` component
- ✅ Permission-based UI element visibility
- ✅ Role-based navigation restrictions

### 2. Cryptographic Failures
- ✅ No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- ✅ Session tokens truncated for display
- ✅ Secure session management

### 3. Injection
- ✅ Input sanitization in search and forms
- ✅ Parameterized API calls
- ✅ HTML entity encoding

### 4. Insecure Design
- ✅ Principle of least privilege implementation
- ✅ Fail-secure defaults
- ✅ Progressive disclosure patterns

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
- ✅ No debug information in production
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage
- ✅ Secure headers and configurations

### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- ✅ Up-to-date dependencies
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ✅ Trusted component libraries only

### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
- ✅ Proper session management
- ✅ Secure logout functionality
- ✅ Session timeout handling

### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
- ✅ Trusted CDN usage
- ✅ Component integrity validation
- ✅ Secure build process

### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- ✅ Client-side error logging
- ✅ Security event tracking
- ✅ Audit trail for role changes

### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- ✅ Validated external API calls
- ✅ URL validation and sanitization
- ✅ Restricted request destinations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd interview-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Demo Login Credentials

The application uses DummyJSON for authentication. You can use any username from their API:

- **Username**: `kminchelle` (or any DummyJSON username)
- **Password**: Any password (DummyJSON accepts any password)
- **Role**: Select from dropdown (admin, ta_member, panelist)

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UI/UX Choices
- **Shadcn/UI**: Chosen for accessibility, customization, and modern design
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for consistent styling
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile users
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed contextually

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to reduce API calls
- **Pagination**: Efficient data loading with 10 items per page
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations

### State Management
- **Context API**: Chosen over Redux for simplicity and built-in React features
- **Local State**: Component-level state for UI interactions
- **Session Storage**: Secure session persistence

## 📊 Performance Features

- **Debounced Search** - Reduces API calls with 300ms delay
- **Pagination** - Efficient data loading
- **Code Splitting** - Automatic route-based splitting
- **Lazy Loading** - Components loaded on demand
- **Optimized Re-renders** - Strategic use of React.memo and useMemo

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The application includes comprehensive error handling and validation:

- **Form Validation** - Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **API Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States** - User feedback during async operations
- **Empty States** - Helpful messaging when no data is available

## 🔄 Build & Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Static Export
```bash
npm run build
```
The application is configured for static export and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **Unit Testing** - React Testing Library implementation
- **E2E Testing** - Playwright or Cypress integration
- **Storybook** - Component documentation and testing
- **PWA Features** - Offline support and push notifications
- **Advanced Analytics** - Detailed performance metrics
